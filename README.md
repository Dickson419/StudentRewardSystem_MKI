# StudentRewardSystem_MKI
A basic GUI with TKinter to award positive or negative points.

The code creates a screen in which five students can be given positive or negative points. There is a lot of work to go into later versions to improve upon this and mkae the application more dynammic.

Largely, this has been a nice accumulation of what I have learnt about Tkinter so far (and a interlude from Msc studies). I intend to create more versions and implement it my classroom at somepoint in the future.
